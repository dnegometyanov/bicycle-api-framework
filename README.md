## Bicycle HTTP API framework, build in 1 weekend

A simple HTTP API framework without dependencies, that was primarily built within 1 weekend.

For installation instruction see README.md in `bicycle-env`

It features:

 - Front controller
 - DI container
 - Request object
 - Router for URLs like `/some-entry-point/{some-var-1}/blabal/{some-var-2}`
 - Dispatcher
 - Entity manager
 - Entity validator
 
 TODO:
 
  - Needs a value object to be available to validate data that can not be mapped to entity (for example, type of variable does not matched)
